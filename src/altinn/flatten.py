"""For flattening Altinn3 xml.files for Dynarev-base in Oracle.

This module contains the functions for flattening the Altinn3 xml-files that
should be loaded into our on-prem Oracle database for Dynarev-base. This are
generic functions that should support all types of xml-forms. It requires
the user to specify how to recode old fieldnames of Altinn2 to the new names
of Altinn3. This is done in a separate file.
