## Features

This is work-in-progress Python-package for dealing with xml-data from Altinn3. Here are some examples of how it can be used:

### Get information about a file

```python
from altinn import FileInfo

file = "gs://ssb-prod-dapla-felles-data-delt/altinn3/form_dc551844cd74.xml"

# Create an instance of FileInfo
form = FileInfo(file)

# Get file filename without '.xml'-postfix
form.filename()
# Returns: 'form_dc551844cd74'

# Print an unformatted version of the file. Does not require the file to be parseable by an xml-library. Useful for inspecting unvalid xml-files.
form.print()

# Print a nicely formatted version of the file
form.pretty_print()

# Check if xml-file is valid. Useful to inspect xml-files with formal errors in the xml-schema.
form.validate()
# Returns True og False
```

### Parse xml-file

If you want to transform an Altinn3 xml-file to a Pandas Dataframe, you can use the ParseSingleXml-class.

```python
from altinn import ParseSingleXml

file = "gs://ssb-prod-dapla-felles-data-delt/altinn3/form_dc551844cd74.xml"

form_content=ParseSingleXml(file)

# Get a Pandas Dataframe representation of the contents of the file
df=form_content.to_dataframe()

df.head()
```

### Transform to ISEE-Dynarev format

If you want to transform an Altinn3 xml-file to a Pandas Dataframe, in the same form as the ISEE Dynarev database in our on-prem environment, you can use the `isee_transform`-function.

```python
from altinn import isee_transform

file = "gs://ssb-prod-dapla-felles-data-delt/altinn3/form_dc551844cd74.xml"

isee_transform(file)
```

If you want to recode/map names in the FELTNAVN-column, you can use a dictionary with the original names from the xml as keys, and the new names as values. And then pass the dictionary as an argument when running the function isee_transform(file, mapping).

```python
from altinn import isee_transform

file = "gs://ssb-prod-dapla-felles-data-delt/altinn3/form_dc551844cd74.xml"

mapping = {
    "original_name1": "ISEE_name1",
    "original_name2": "ISEE_name2",
    "original_name2": "ISEE_name3",
}

isee_transform(file, mapping)
```
The function handles flat structures and 'tables' in the XML. If the XML contains repeating values, it puts a suffix containig a number at the end of the FELTNAVN-column. If the XML-contains more complex structures as 'table in table' if will give a warning with a list of which values in FELTNAVN that needs to be further processed before it can be used in ISEE. In this case no suffix will be added.

The XML needs to contain certain fields in the 'InternInfo'-block, The required filds are:
- 'enhetsIdent'
- 'enhetsType'
- 'delregNr'

If one or more of these fields are missing in the XML, the processing will stop, giving a message with witch fields that are missing.


The resulting object is a Pandas Dataframe with the following columns:

- `SKJEMA_ID`
- `DELREG_NR`
- `IDENT_NR`
- `ENHETS_TYPE`
- `FELTNAVN`
- `FELTVERDI`
- `VERSION_NR`

This dataframe can be written to csv and uploaded to the ISEE Dynarev database.

## Requirements

- dapla-toolbelt >=1.6.2
- defusedxml >=0.7.1
- xmltodict >=0.13.0
- pandas >= 2.2.0

## Installation

You can install _SSB Altinn Python_ via [poetry] from [PyPI]:

```console
poetry add ssb-altinn-python
```

To install this in the Jupyter-environment on Dapla, where it is ment to be used, it is required to install it in an virtual environment. It is recommended to do this in an [ssb-project](https://manual.dapla.ssb.no/jobbe-med-kode.html) where the preferred tool is [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
